A multi-purpose reporting database has been created for deployment on our LAMP stack (under the Drupal CMS) that allows reports to be constructed. Each data type that is created can be accessed by a REST interface that allows for a description of the record as well as creating or updating records. New record types are created by creating custom Content Types in the Drupal system. These content types can be used with the Views module (or other modules) to create reports for end-user consumption.
